Vistors to Los Angeles can have a hard time finding the most interesting places in the area to visit.  LA is huge, and has many prime tourist spots.
For those that want to find better local favorites, Gguide gives you better access to what residents think are the best places to visit.
Gguide is a mobile Android application that allows users to engage with other residents of a neighborhood, city, or a general area. Users can pinpoint local spots of interests in realtime between two devices. 
Guides can show tourists the culture and interests of a neighborhood that they otherwise would not be able to find from online sources.
